1) We would like to archive and compress all of the files that are larger than
   5 meg. After making the archive, those files need to be removed from the 
   system, and the archive needs to be moved to the flash memory that is already
   attached to our /media/TOSHIBA7.4 folder.
   For your information, moving a file to your flash memory can be simply done
   by:
   mv  your_file /media/TOSHIBA7.4/

Answer 1)

for name in `find / -type f -size +5M`;
do
        tar -rvf archive.tar $name
        rm $name
done

gzip archive.tar
mv archive.tar.gz /media/TOSHIBA7.4/


2) Please show how to empty the entire /tmp directory after reboot.
   NOTE: you need to use the cron facility to do this task.

Answer 2)

crontab -e

@reboot rm -rf ~/tmp/*
