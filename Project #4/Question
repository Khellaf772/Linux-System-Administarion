This homework is in fact the continuation of the previous homework (acct_mgr) .
In this homework assignment, we would like to add some extra options:

-d   for delete user(s)
-s   show users


examples:

acct_mgr -d good bad pretty
Will delete good, bad and pretty users.

act_mgr -d -f myfile
Will delete all of the users whose login-ids are given the file "myfile".

acct_mgr -s 
will show all of the login-ids of the users.
Please note that we might also include a regular expression too.
For example: 
acct_mgr -s "^m"
will show all of the login-ids of the users whose login-ids begin with "m" .

acct_mgr -s "^....$"
will show all of the login-ids of the users whose login-ids consist of 4 characters.

Notes:  when you are removing the user's accounts, please make sure to delete all of
the user's belongings too (his home directory, files, ...).

This homework assignment is very sensitive. One small mistake might wipe out all of
the user's accounts, and their belongings. Please be very careful when you are 
testing your shell script.
