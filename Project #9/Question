Write a shell script to behave like the "last" command, but it should also accept
the CRN number of a course. 
If the CRN is used, then our script will show the latest login/logoff activity
of all of the students in that class.
For example:

show_them 30821

would display the latest login/logoff activities of the students in our CS260A
class.

In the above example, I assumed the name of our shell script is "show_them".

Some other examples:

show_them        is equivalent to:  last
show_them -f /var/run/utmp     is equivalent to:   last -f /var/run/utmp
show_them -f /var/run/utmp   30821
