In this assignment, we need to do some practice with the /etc/group file on hills.
We need to write a shell script called "course_info". This script is displaying
information about the specific course represented by its CRN number.

The script accepts the following options:
     -i:  displays all student login-ids
     -n:  displays number of students
     -t:  displays the login-id of the instructor
     -a:  displays all of the above
     -h:  displays the help menu 

For example:

course_info -i  35690
will display the login-ids of all of the students in the class with the CRN number
35690 .

course_info -t 43578
will display the login-ids of the instructor of  the class with the CRN number
43578 .


course_info -n 43432
will display the number of students in the class represented by the CRN number
43432 .

If the CRN number does not exist, then an error message will be displayed.
