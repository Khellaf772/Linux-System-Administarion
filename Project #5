1) Create an account called temp_empl. This account should be expired on 5/15/28 .

$sudo useradd -e 2028-05-15 temp_empl

2) How would you lock all of those user's accounts which are using ksh?

   We can use the usermod command with the -L option to lock the account 
   for i in $(getent passwd | grep ksh$ | cut -d: -f1); do
      sudo usermod -L $i 
   done

   OR 

   for i in $(getent passwd | grep "/ksh$" | cut -d: -f1); do
      sudo passwd -l $i
    done

3) What does the following line do in /etc/sudoers ? 

   wall  wall = (wall) /bin/wall

This gives the user "wall" the ability to run the wall command on the wall host 
as user wall.

4) The default shell for any newly created user's account is /bin/bash . How
   would you change it to /bin/ksh ? 
   To change the default shell we can edit the configuration file at 
	/etc/default/useradd
	and specify SHELL=/bin/ksh

   OR

   useradd -D -s /bin/ksh

   so the default shell for newly created users is set to /bin/skh

	
5) What does the following command do?

    chage  -d  0  jlin
	
   It forces the user "jlin" to change his password next time that he logs in.	

6) Please show how to count number of crontab files on your system.

   $sudo ls /var/spool/cron/crontabs/ | wc -l

7) Without using /etc/cron.deny, please show how would you allow everybody to
   use the cron facility on your system.
   One way could be to 
   delete the cron.allow file if it exists 
   sudo rm -f /etc/cron.allow
   or
   we can add all the users on the system to the cron.allow file
   getent passwd | cut -d: -f1 >> /etc/cron.allow

8) What do the following lines do in your crontab file?

   */5  *  *  *  *  cp  /dev/null  /usr/master_file
   0  *  *  *  *   /usr/cleanup

1. Erase the contents of /usr/master_file every five minutes.
2. Run the contents of /usr/cleanup every hour.


9) Please create an account for alex with the user-id of 850  and /bin/csh shell.

	
   $sudo useradd -m -u 850 alex -s /bin/csh


10) Please show how to delete those accounts with the uid in the range of 2500-3000.
   We can filter users with user ids 2500-3000 and then for each user execute the
   userdel command with the -r option to remove their home directories.

	users=$(getent passwd | cut -d: -f1,3 | grep -E ":[2][5-9][0-9]{2}$|:[3][0]{3}$ | cut -d: -f1")
	for userName in $users; do sudo userdel -r $userName; done;
   OR

awk -F':' '{ print $1}' /etc/passwd | while read line; do
  uid=$(id -u "$line")
  if [[ $uid -ge 2500 && $uid -le 3000 ]]; then
    userdel -r "$line"
  fi
done
