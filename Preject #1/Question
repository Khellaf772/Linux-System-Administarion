One of the jobs of any sys-admin is writing or modifying shell scripts. 
In this homework assignment, we would like to start practicing with shell scripting.

Very often, a sys-admin needs to create some junk or trash files. For example 
creating 35 files with the size of 200 bytes each. Or create a file with the size
of one mega byte. 
We would like to make a shell script called "mkfiles". This script should be able
to create any number of files, with any size. 
For example:

mkfiles -s 3000 -n 5 -f goody
would generate 5 files with 3000 bytes each. The name of the files would be goody1,
goody2, goody3, goody4, and goody5.

In this script, -f followed by the filename is used to provide the filename.
If the -f option is missing, then the default filename is "noname'.
-n is used for number of files.
If -n is missing, then only one file will be generated.
-s is used to specify the size of the file in bytes.
If -s is missing, then the default file size will be zero.
-h would display the help menu.

mkfiles -h   would display the help menu.

-v would display the names of all of the generated files.
